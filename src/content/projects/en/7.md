title: "Underwater Dialogue"
description: "Two squids cross paths in an imagined sea, outlined in blue and surrounded by shapes that don’t aim to represent, but to suggest movement, rhythm, vibration. This piece is a conversation between creatures that don’t speak, yet understand each other. The undulating lines and orange circles create a visual score where each tentacle is a note. I wanted to capture that moment when the natural becomes design, and the wild transforms into emotional geometry."
