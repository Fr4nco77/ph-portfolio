title: "Tentacled Office"
description: "This piece is an explosion of the unexpected. A red octopus bursts into routine, wrapping bodies and disrupting the space as if logic had been laid off. I wanted to capture that moment when the fantastical overrides the bureaucratic, when the inner monster emerges in the middle of the workday. Itâ€™s a work about stress, about struggle, about the absurd that lives within what we call normality. Each tentacle is a metaphor, each gesture a reaction to the impossible."
