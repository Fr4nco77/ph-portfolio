title: "Whale of Dreams"
description: "This piece is a journey between worlds. A whale glides through a starry sky as if the ocean were too small for its spirit. Beneath it, snow-covered mountains and rivers that twist like deep thoughts. I wanted to create a scene where the impossible feels natural, where immensity becomes intimate. Itâ€™s a visual meditation on freedom, mystery, and the beauty of what needs no explanation."
