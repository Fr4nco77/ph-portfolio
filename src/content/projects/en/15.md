title: "Flower in the Gaze"
description: "This piece is a portrait of calm and presence. The serene face, adorned with a flower and a bindi, conveys a silent elegance that needs no ornament. With black and white lines, I aimed to highlight the essential: expression, detail, dignity. Itâ€™s a work that speaks of identity without loudness, that celebrates the everyday as an act of beauty. Each stroke seeks to honor what remains when everything else fades."
