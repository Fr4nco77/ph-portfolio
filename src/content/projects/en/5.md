title: "Deep Blue"
description: "Sometimes imagination dives where logic cannot reach. This illustration was born from a desire to explore the aquatic world through a childlike and overflowing lens. The shark, with its oversized eye and simplified lines, swims among bubbles and orange shapes that aim not to represent, but to suggest. Itâ€™s a celebration of color, visual rhythm, and the freedom to draw without asking realism for permission. Here, the ocean is a playground, and the predator becomes a storybook character."
