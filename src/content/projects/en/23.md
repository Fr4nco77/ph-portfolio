title: "Wild Majesty"
description: "This piece is a portrait of nobility. The deer, with its direct gaze and antlers like crowns, becomes a guardian of the forest—a symbol of quiet strength. Every line of its fur and every curve of its antlers was drawn to honor what needs no words: the dignity of the wild. It’s a work about respect, about connection with nature, about beauty that asserts itself effortlessly."
