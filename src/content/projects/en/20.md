title: "Solar Garden"
description: "This piece is a hymn to abundance. The sunflower, in full bloom, becomes an earthly sun, radiating color and vitality. Surrounded by leaves and flowers intertwined like joyful thoughts, I wanted to capture that moment when nature turns into celebration. Itâ€™s a work about light, about growth, about beauty that blooms without asking for permission. Each petal is an affirmation, each shadow a caress of summer."
