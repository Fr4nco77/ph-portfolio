title: "The Silence Guard"
description: "This piece was born from a fascination with ceremonial discipline and the iconic aesthetic of the British royal guards. Against a vibrant red background, five figures align like notes in a visual score: rigid, symmetrical, almost meditative. Their presence needs no wordsâ€”they are symbol, ritual, history. With simple strokes and a limited palette, I aim to capture the solemnity of the everyday when it becomes art."
