title: "Autumn Refuge"
description: "This piece is a sigh within the landscape. The cabin, reflected in still waters, becomes a symbol of retreat, of pause, of inner home. The warm hills and bare trees speak of time passing, of the beauty that remains when everything is stripped away. I wanted to capture that moment when silence becomes company, when the surroundings embrace without a word. Itâ€™s a work about calm, about belonging, about the art of staying still."
