title: "Lavender Attitude"
description: "This piece is a visual statement. The figure, with pink sunglasses and vibrant accessories, presents herself with a confidence that needs no explanation. The gesture of adjusting the glasses is almost a ritual—a way of saying 'I’m here' without uttering a word. I wanted to capture that moment when fashion becomes language, where every color and every line speaks of identity. It’s a work about style, about presence, about the power of showing up exactly as one chooses."
