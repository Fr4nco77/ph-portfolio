title: "The Eye of Instinct"
description: "This piece is an invitation to look beyond the visible. The feline eye, vibrant and vertical, becomes a symbol of alertness, mystery, and contained power. Each line of the orange fur draws attention toward that hypnotic center, where calm and hunt converge. I wanted to capture the essence of the animal that watches without being seen, that decides without announcing. Itâ€™s a work about perception, about what is revealed when one dares to hold the gaze."
