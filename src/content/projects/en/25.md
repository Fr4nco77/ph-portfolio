title: "Luminous Skull"
description: "This piece is a meditation on form and transience. The skull, drawn with anatomical precision, becomes a symbol of what remains when everything else is gone. The pastel background, almost celestial, wraps the bone structure as if death had its own aura. I wanted to merge the technical with the poetic, the hard with the soft, to create an image that is not only seen but felt. It’s a work about memory, about essence, about the beauty that persists in what’s left behind."
