title: "Vanilla Tentacle"
description: "What happens when the craving for sweetness meets the wild? This piece is a visual provocation—an impossible blend of ice cream cone and octopus that refuses to be eaten. The tentacles twist like repressed thoughts, while the turquoise background turns the strange into something deliciously appealing. It’s a work that plays with appetite and confusion, inviting a second look and asking whether absurdity might, in fact, be a form of truth."
