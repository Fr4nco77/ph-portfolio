title: "Visual Language"
description: "This piece is an exploration of gesture as symbol. A slightly open mouth, vibrant lips, suggestive tongue—everything becomes a code that needs no translation. The orange background amplifies the contrast, as if desire had turned into color. I wanted to play with the tension between the explicit and the implied, between the bodily and the iconic. It’s a work that speaks without words, that screams from graphic silence and turns the everyday into aesthetic provocation."
