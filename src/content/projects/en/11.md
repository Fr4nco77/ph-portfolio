title: "Figure in Orange"
description: "This piece is a study in presence. The character, with deep blue skin, stands out against a vibrant background as if emerging from a graphic dream. The cream fabric with orange accents falls like a silent statement—a blend of tradition and modernity. I wanted to explore the power of contrast, how a figure can speak without words, hold the viewer’s gaze, and leave questions floating in the air. It’s a work about identity, about what we show and what we hide."
