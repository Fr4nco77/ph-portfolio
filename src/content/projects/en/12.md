title: "Portrait at Rest"
description: "This piece is a tribute to stillness. The figure, seated naturally with a sideways gaze, conveys a calm that needs no explanation. With a minimal palette and clean lines, I aimed to capture that intimate moment where the body rests but the mind keeps traveling. The soft background and vertical shapes create a silent rhythm, as if time had paused just to contemplate. Itâ€™s a work about presence, about being without making noise."
