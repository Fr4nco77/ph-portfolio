title: "After the Impact"
description: "This scene is a frozen moment in the midst of chaos. A body held, a gaze that cannot comprehend, a yellow vehicle retreating like a silent witness. I wanted to capture the weight of the unexpectedâ€”the moment when everything changes and the world slows down. The vibrant colors contrast with the implicit pain, as if the aesthetic were trying to soften the wound. This piece speaks of fragility, of humanity, and of how even in disaster there is beauty worth telling."
