title: "Stellar Contact"
description: "Two hands reach for each other in the void, barely touching at the fingertips, as if the universe depended on that moment. One is flesh, the other constellation. The starry black drips as if the cosmos were spilling over the human. I wanted to capture that instant where the divine and the earthly brush against each other, where art becomes a bridge between worlds. Itâ€™s a piece about connection, about creation, about the power of a minimal gesture that says everything."
