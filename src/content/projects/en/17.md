title: "Compass Rose"
description: "This piece is a meditation on direction. The compass rose, with its warm colors and precise symmetry, becomes a mandala of decisions. Each cardinal point is a possibility, each line a story yet to be drawn. I wanted to transform a navigation instrument into a contemplative object, where the journey is not only physical but also emotional. Itâ€™s a work about direction, about choice, about the art of getting lost in order to be found."
