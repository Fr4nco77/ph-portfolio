title: "Wings of the Unconscious"
description: "This piece is a dance between the human and the dark. The face, partially hidden by raven wings, dissolves into brushstrokes that resemble broken thoughts. The birds don’t just fly—they emerge, merge, and become extensions of the soul. I wanted to capture that moment when inner chaos takes shape, when pain transforms into flight. It’s a work about metamorphosis, about what inhabits us in silence, about the beauty born from rupture."
