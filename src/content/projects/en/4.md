title: "Bearer of Stars"
description: "In this piece, I wanted to explore the connection between the human and the cosmic. The figure holds a star as if it were a luminous secret, while her hair transforms into a night sky breathing constellations. Itâ€™s a portrait of introspection, of how we carry entire galaxies within us without knowing. The contrast between the neutral background and the celestial explosion highlights that duality: the everyday and the infinite, the simple and the sacred."
