title: "Stellar Fall"
description: "This illustration captures that suspended moment between dream and universe, where the body floats but the mind sinks. The figure, dressed in a school uniform, drifts through a cosmos of blues and purples as if gravity were a distant memory. Itâ€™s an exploration of vulnerability, of the invisible weight that pulls us even through the most beautiful landscapes. With each star, a question; with each stroke, an emotion that cannot be named. This piece is my way of speaking about the vertigo of growing up."
