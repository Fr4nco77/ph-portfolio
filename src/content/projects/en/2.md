title: "The Stream Guardian"
description: "This illustration was born on a contemplative afternoon, when the silence of the water whispered stories of creatures that watch without being seen. The protagonist, a serene otter perched on a rock, observes its world with the calm of one who belongs. Surrounded by reeds and golden reflections, this little guardian embodies the harmony between the wild and the tender. With soft colors and playful lines, I sought to capture that moment when nature becomes a character."
