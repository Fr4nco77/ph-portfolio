title: "Pulse of the Abyss"
description: "This piece is a tribute to the creatures that dwell in the deep, where light barely reaches but imagination flourishes. The squid, outlined in blues and whites, unfolds like a dance among bubbles and invisible currents. The yellow background, almost solar, defies marine logic and turns the ocean into a stage. I wanted to capture that moment when the strange becomes beautiful, and the wild transforms into a symbol of movement and mystery."
