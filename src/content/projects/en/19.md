title: "Fragmented Face"
description: "This piece is an exploration of form as language. A human profile built with minimal geometry, where the eye is a perfect circle and the worn texture suggests memory, history, erosion. I wanted to portray identity as something that is both constructed and weathered, like a mask that reveals more than it hides. Itâ€™s a work about presence, about what remains when everything is stripped down to the essential."
