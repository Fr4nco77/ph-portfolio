title: "Crown of Silence"
description: "This piece is a tribute to serene strength. The feminine face, surrounded by flowers that resemble crowns, radiates a peace that needs no words. With closed eyes and red lips, the figure becomes icon, altar, symbol. I wanted to fuse the human with the ritual, the decorative with the spiritual. Each petal, each line, each color is a visual prayer. Itâ€™s a work about introspection, about beauty that blooms from within."
