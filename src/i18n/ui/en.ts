    subtitle: "I illustrate to give life to the invisible",
    top: {
      p1: "I’m an illustrator passionate about transforming emotions into images. My work is born at the intersection between the dreamlike and the tangible, where feminine characters dance among watercolors and inks, and nature becomes its own language.",
      p2: "Each illustration I create is a window into worlds where poetry takes shape. I draw inspiration from everyday wonders: light filtering through leaves, the movement of fabric in the wind, the fleeting expression on a face.",

      p2: "I’m fascinated by exploring the feminine figure in all its expressions: strong, vulnerable, dreamy, determined. My characters inhabit worlds where nature is not just a backdrop, but a protagonist that embraces, protects, and transforms.",
      p3: "I believe art has the power to move, to pause time, to build bridges between people. My philosophy is simple: every illustration should tell a story, awaken an emotion, and invite the viewer to dive into a moment of beauty and reflection.",
